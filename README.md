# Project Synopsis
Calcium carbonate (CaCO₃) plays a critical role in the development and growth of calcifying invertebrates, such as crustaceans, which rely on this mineral for exoskeletal construction during molting (ecdysis). In commercial aquaculture, particularly within recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS), controlling molting is key to optimizing yield—especially for soft-shell crabs, which command high market value. However, the impacts of elevated calcium concentrations on crustacean physiology remain poorly understood, especially regarding potential stress or mortality from mineral overaccumulation.
  This project investigated how increased CaCO₃ concentrations affect the physiology and behavior of the hairy shore crab (Hemigrapsus oregonensis) when housed in RAS. We hypothesized that elevated calcium levels would initially promote molting due to increased calcium availability but could ultimately cause physiological stress, impaired mobility, and increased mortality due to excessive internal and external accumulation.
  To test this, crabs were collected from Puget Sound and maintained in laboratory RAS tanks under two temperature regimes: ambient (13°C) and elevated (27°C). Each temperature condition included a control and a treatment group, the latter dosed with calcium carbonate to raise water calcium concentrations from 400 mg/L to 600 mg/L. Over 14 days, physiological and behavioral data were collected weekly, including hemolymph lactate levels (a stress marker), righting response times (a measure of motor function), and mortality counts. Gills and carapaces were also visually inspected for signs of calcium deposition.
  Results showed complete mortality in the high-calcium, high-temperature group, suggesting that the combination of elevated CaCO₃ and heat led to acute physiological failure. In the low-temperature, high-calcium group, calcium buildup was observed in the gills, though lactate and righting time data did not indicate statistically significant stress—likely due to small sample sizes and data loss. Nonetheless, visual evidence of mineral accumulation, paired with mortality patterns, supports the hypothesis that excessive calcium impairs normal physiology.
  This study provides preliminary evidence that while calcium is essential for molting, there exists a threshold beyond which it becomes detrimental. These findings underscore the importance of precise calcium regulation in RAS management and point to a need for more detailed studies that monitor calcium uptake throughout the molting cycle. Future work should also incorporate broader calcium ranges, higher sample sizes, and more refined physiological markers to better determine safe and effective mineral levels for crustacean aquaculture
